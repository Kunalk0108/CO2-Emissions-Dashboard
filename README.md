CO₂ Emissions Dashboard
Overview

This project involves the creation of an interactive Excel dashboard to analyze and visualize CO₂ emissions data from 1995 to 2018 across various countries and industries. The dashboard provides insights into emission trends, year-over-year changes, and top-emitting countries, enabling a comprehensive understanding of global CO₂ emissions.
Features

    Data Cleaning and Transformation:
        Cleaned raw data by removing blanks, outliers, and zero values.
        Unpivoted year columns using Power Query for flexible data analysis.

    Interactive Dashboard:
        Dynamic visualizations created using Pivot Tables and Pivot Charts.
        Slicers for filtering data by country, industry, and years.
        Conditional formatting and heat maps to highlight trends and anomalies.

    Key Analyses:
        Total emissions by country and industry.
        Year-over-year emission changes.
        Top 5 emitting countries and industry-specific trends.

Dataset

    The dataset contains CO₂ emissions data from 1995 to 2018, categorized by:
        Country Name: Full names and abbreviations of countries.
        Industry: Sectors such as transportation, agriculture, and energy.
        Emission Type: Focused on CO₂ emissions.
        Years: Emissions data for each year in the specified period.

How to Use

    Open the Excel file CO2_Emissions_Dashboard.xlsx.
